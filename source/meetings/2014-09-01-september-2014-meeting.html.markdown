This month, we've got two great talks lined up that I'm really excited about!

## Getting Grounded
### Max Murphy, Lead DevOps Engineer, Kongregate

Max is going to talk about how we can take lessons learned from using cloud technologies and apply them on the ground, in a standard data center. Max Murphy is a Lead DevOps engineer for Kongregate.

## Deis, Your PaaS, your rules: [deis.io](http://deis.io/)
### Chris Armstrong, Senior Software Engineer, OpDemand

Deis is an open-source Platform-as-a-Service inspired by Heroku and powered by CoreOS and Docker. Chris will demo Deis and discuss how it uses CoreOS and Docker to enable developers to deploy their applications to cloud providers or bare metal with just a 'git push'.

Chris Armstrong is a core maintainer of Deis and Senior Software Engineer at OpDemand, where he focuses on customer growth and community. He loves contributing to open source and interacting with its community.

A big thank you to Chris for making the trip down from Seattle to present to us!

As always, there will be pizza and refreshments. Doors open at 6:30pm, meeting starts at 7pm. Looking forward to seeing you all Wednesday night!
