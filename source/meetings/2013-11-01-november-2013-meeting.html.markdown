Jason LaPier, Lead Cloud Architect, and Max Murphy, Senior DevOps Engineer at Elemental Technologies will talk about taking a software product and stack designed to run on specific hardware and migrating it to cloud-based deployments. Challenges and features that will be covered:

* maintaining development parity with the continued hardware-deployed versions of the software;
* managing strict software package requirements;
* making products available in all AWS regions;
* using AWS's Virtual Private Cloud networking capabilities;
* using centralized logging to monitor and maintain multiple cloud-based deployments.
