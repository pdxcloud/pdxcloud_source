## Topic: Automate your CI and Deployment Processes
### Maciej "Ski" Skierkowski
#### CEO, [Factor.io](http://factor.io)

One of the top challenges of developing web-based services is building the continuous deployment process. Engineering teams spend over 30% of their developer resources building processes like “Deploy my app to Heroku from Github when I say 'deploy' in HipChat”. Most of this time is spent gluing together numerous services (e.g. Github, AWS, Hipchat) and technologies (e.g. Chef, Salt Stack) to work in a cohesive workflow. Maciej Skierkowski, co-founder and CEO of Factor.io, will show how you can automate your continuous integration and deployment processes in just a couple minutes.
