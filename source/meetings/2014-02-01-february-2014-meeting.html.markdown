Let’s see if we can put together a list of tools and tips targeted to companies and organizations just getting started with cloud technology. The end goal would be to create a community-written how-to resource that we could post to pdxcloud.org.

Tools:

* Cloud Service Providers
* Configuration Management Systems
* Monitoring/Alerting
* Centralized Logging
* Cost Management
* Code/Deployment Management

Tips:

* Security
* Development in Cloud
  * Eventual Consistency
  * Design for Failure
  * Distributed Systems
* Backup and Disaster Recovery Planning

If you have more categories to add to the list, please bring them to the meeting. If you have a tool or technique you’d like to demonstrate or present on (formally or informally), that would be fantastic. And most importantly, if you can identify gaps in your cloud technology knowledge or implementation that you’d like to delve into as part of this discussion, definitely plan to share those points.

As always, there will be pizza and refreshments. Doors open at 6:30pm, meeting starts at 7pm. Looking forward to seeing you all Wednesday night!
