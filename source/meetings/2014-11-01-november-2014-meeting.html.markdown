Hey everyone - our next PDXCloud meetup is November 12th.

*This will be our 2nd birthday!* Come celebrate two years of PDXCloud with us. There will be cake! And of course pizza, beer, and other refreshments. We also have two talks lined up.

## Building a Fault Tolerant API with [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix)
### Ryan Dearing, Bodybuilding.com

See how Bodybuilding.com utilizes Hystrix to scale a REST API beyond a hundred million requests every day. Learn how we use Hystrix to build a distributed system that is both fault and latency tolerant. We will discuss the bulkhead and circuit breaker patterns used by Hystrix to provide a resilient and fast API.

## Intro to [Splunk](http://splunk.com)
### Jason LaPier, Lead Architect, Elemental Cloud

On the surface, Splunk is a log aggregator, but once you start to go beyond that, you can see the potential and the power of Splunk as a data management tool. I'll briefly go over the components and architecture of Splunk, some of the key features and product offerings, and then dive into a demo of how it works and how we use it at Elemental. Centralized logging is a critical tool in a cloud-based environment, as it lets you review the history and analysis of data from instances that have come and gone at any time.

As always, doors will open at 6:30PM, so feel free to show up a little early to grab food and drink and do some socializing. Presentations will start at 7PM.
