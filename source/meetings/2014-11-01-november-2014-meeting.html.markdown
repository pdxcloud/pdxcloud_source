Hey everyone - our next PDXCloud meetup is November 12th.

*This will be our 2nd birthday!* Come celebrate two years of PDXCloud with us. There will be cake! And of course pizza, beer, and other refreshments.

Right now we have one talk lined up that I'm pretty excited about. If anyone has a second topic, I'd love to get another one on the agenda. Shoot me an email at jason.lapier AT gmail.com.

## Building a Fault Tolerant API with [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix)
### Ryan Dearing, Bodybuilding.com

See how Bodybuilding.com utilizes Hystrix to scale a REST API beyond a hundred million requests every day. Learn how we use Hystrix to build a distributed system that is both fault and latency tolerant. We will discuss the bulkhead and circuit breaker patterns used by Hystrix to provide a resilient and fast API.


As always, doors will open at 6:30PM, so feel free to show up a little early to grab food and drink and do some socializing. Presentation will start at 7PM.
