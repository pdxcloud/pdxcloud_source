## Panel: Why We Chose Cloud, and What We've Learned
### Representatives from Portland Companies

PDXCloud met for the first time in November 2012, and now it's time to celebrate our one year anniversary!

This Wednesday we will have a panel of guests talking around the theme, "Why We Chose Cloud, and What We've Learned". We have a group of panelists (many thanks to those that have agreed to sit on the panel so far), and we still have room for a few more if anyone is interested. If you have any inclination to answer questions about your company's use of cloud technologies and the factors and decisions that went into selecting those technologies, please send me an email (jason.lapier@gmail.com). No presentations will be required, this will mainly be a Q&A session.

For the rest of you, bring plenty of questions for our panelists!

As usual, we'll have pizza, beer, and other refreshments, and additionally, we'll have a birthday cake to celebrate PDXCloud's 1 year anniversary!

As usual, doors open at 6:30pm, meeting starts at 7pm. Hope to see you on Wednesday!
