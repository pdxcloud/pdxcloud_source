## Topic: State of Distributed Systems and Tiered Applications
### Adron Hall
#### [Composite Code](http://compositecode.com/), [NodePDX](http://nodepdx.org/)

UPDATE: Adron's slides and thoughts can be found here: [Composite Code: PDX Cloud â€“ A Question Posed](http://compositecode.com/2013/10/11/pdx-cloud-a-question-posed/).

#### Original Synopsis

Adron will dive into distributed systems and what they've enabled us to create - vast super computers, huge social networks, e-commerce, and more - and then he'll go into tiered systems and what they bring us - faster development time, domain specific and line of business applications, and so on. From there, he'll bring those two topics into the cloud and talk about what that technology has brought us, and where we're headed in the future.

To wrap it up, Adron will talk about what the next steps are for the industry: what's needed and where are the weak points? Where do we break down when trying to build large systems vs. fast systems vs. easy to build and maintain systems?

Doors open at 6:30 and meeting begins at 7pm.
