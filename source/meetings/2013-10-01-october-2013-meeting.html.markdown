## Topic: Open Discussion
We're still waiting to see if anyone wants to do a formal presentation this Wednesday evening. If we can't find a speaker, let's plan on a general sharing of cloud experiences. If there are any topics of discussion you'd like to request, or if there are points you've learned about cloud tech that you'd like to share, please bring them! Feel free to hit up the mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pdxcloud) and toss around some ideas.

Doors open at 6:30 and meeting begins at 7pm.
