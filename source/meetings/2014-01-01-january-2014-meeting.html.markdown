And generous sponsors are buying us dinner and beer. This meetup is quickly growing to be one of the most interesting events in the Northwest for those wanting to stay on top of advancement in the future of computing."

Meeting is held at Jama South:
334 NW 11th Ave, Portland

6pm to 9pm. See [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-Northwest/events/151114422/) for more details.
