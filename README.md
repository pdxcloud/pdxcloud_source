Topics include, working with vendors such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform,
Rackspace, etc, working with open-source implementations such as OpenStack, and
developing cloud-based services, sites, and tools in both vendor-specific and
vendor-agnotic ways. We meet the second Wednesday of every month. We welcome developers
